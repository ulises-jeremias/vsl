# IMPORTANT
This is in a very early stage of development. Issues are to be expected.
The lack of features is the major problem right now, but these are slowly but
surely going to be added. If you find any problem, please file an issue and
we will try to solve it as soon as possible. Any suggestion is welcome.

`vsl.plot` tries to follow the structure of [Plotly's](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/)
[graph_objects](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/). Check the examples folder
and compare it to Plotly's Python examples for a better understanding.

**NOT ALL GRAPH TYPES ARE SUPPORTED YET.**

We currently have:
- scatter
- pie
- heatmap
- surface
- scatter3d
- bar
